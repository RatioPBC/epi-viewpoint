      | This site uses
      i<> multi-factor authentication
      | for additional security.
        In addition to your email address and password, you will use a six digit
        number called a
      i<> one-time password
      | that is automatically generated by a device that only you have access to.

    p
      | Make sure you have an app that will generate a one-time password.
        Typically, this will be an app on your mobile phone that is made specifically
        for generating one-time passwords, such as Microsoft Authenticator.
        Alternatively, some password managment software, such as 1Password, can
        generate one-time passwords.

    p
      b> If you don't have a multi-factor authentication app, or aren’t sure,
      = link "download Microsoft Authenticator", to: "https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/account/authenticator"
      | .

      header Step 1
      p Scan this code with your authenticator app:

      #qr-code data-role="qr-code" = raw @svg

      p#alternate
        | If your authenticator app doesn’t support code scanning,
          you can instead type this code into your authenticator app‘s
          “code“ or “secret key“ field:

      code data-role="secret" = raw colorize_alphanumeric_string(@secret)

      code#secret-legend
        | (
        = raw colorize_alphanumeric_string("1234567890 ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ")
        | )

      header Step 2

      p
        | After scanning or entering the code, your authenticator app should show a six-digit number
          that changes every 30 seconds. Type that number below to verify that everything is working.
